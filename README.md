This project aims to develop a system which converts a natural language statement into 
SQL query to retrieve information from respective database. The natural language input statement 
taken from the user is passed through various Open NLP natural language processing techniques 
like Tokenization, Parts of Speech Tagging, Stemming and Lemmatization to get the statement in 
the desired form. The statement is further processed to extract the type of query. The final query 
is generated by converting the basic and condition clauses to their query form and then 
concatenating the condition query to the basic query. Currently, the system works only with Oracle 
SQL database.
We investigate avenues of using natural English utterances - sentence or sentence 
fragments - to extract data from an SQL, a narrower inspection of the broader natural language to 
machine language problem. We intend to contribute to the goal of a robust natural language to data 
retrieval system.
